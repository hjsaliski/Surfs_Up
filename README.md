We will be using jupyter notebook along with SQLlite for this analysis

**Summary**

  For the results of our finding we can clearly see the average temperatures for the months of June and December across the SQL file that was sent to us. We have the miniumum and maximum temperatures along with the number of counts or times a temperature was taken. For additional queries I added a few more filters on the database to find the precipitaion data along with the temperature and specific month we are looking for.<img width="976" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-19 at 11 56 07" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102257486/169370569-e11600d9-a6e8-4bac-b88f-bab6d89f9742.png">

I then created another query to search for this data by the specific station that recorded the data. I created an input function that will allow us to search for a specific station and seen the results of temperature and precipitation from that station. While both of these screenshots are taken of December I also added the function to run with june numbers as well.
